# Valid Parentheses

def isValid(s: str) -> bool:

# This line defines a function named `isValid` that takes a string `s` as input
# and returns a boolean value.

    stack = []

# This line initializes an empty list named `stack`. This will be used as a
# stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets.

    mapping = {")": "(", "}": "{", "]": "["}

# This line creates a dictionary named `mapping` that maps each closing bracket
# to its corresponding opening bracket.

    for char in s:

# This line starts a for loop that iterates over each character in the input
# string `s`.

        if char in mapping:

# This line checks if the current character is a closing bracket (i.e., if it's
# a key in the `mapping` dictionary).

            top_element = stack.pop() if stack else '#'

# If the current character is a closing bracket, this line pops the top element
# from the stack if it's not empty; otherwise, it sets `top_element` to `'#'`.

            if mapping[char] != top_element:

# This line checks if the opening bracket that corresponds to the current
# closing bracket (according to the `mapping` dictionary) is not the same as
# `top_element`.

                return False

# If the opening bracket that corresponds to the current closing bracket is not
# the same as `top_element`, this line immediately returns `False`, indicating
# that the input string `s` is not valid.

        else:

# This line starts an else block that gets executed if the current character is
# not a closing bracket.

            stack.append(char)

# If the current character is not a closing bracket, this line appends it to the
# stack.

    return not stack

# After all characters in the input string `s` have been processed, this line
# returns `True` if the stack is empty (indicating that all opening brackets
# have been properly closed) and `False` otherwise.
