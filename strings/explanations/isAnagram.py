# Valid Anagram

def isAnagram(s: str, t: str) -> bool:

# This line defines a function named `isAnagram` that takes two parameters, `s`
# and `t`, both of which are strings. The function is expected to return a
# boolean value (`True` or `False`).

    return Counter(s) == Counter(t)

# This line is the body of the function. The `Counter` function from the
# `collections` module is used here. `Counter` takes an iterable (in this case,
# a string) and returns a dictionary where the keys are the unique elements in
# the iterable and the values are the counts of each element.

# So, `Counter(s)` and `Counter(t)` each return a dictionary of character counts
# for the strings `s` and `t` respectively.

# The `==` operator is then used to compare these two dictionaries. If they are
# identical (i.e., if both strings contain exactly the same characters in the
# same quantities), the function will return `True`, indicating that `s` and `t`
# are anagrams of each other. If the dictionaries are not identical, the
# function will return `False`, indicating that `s` and `t` are not anagrams.
