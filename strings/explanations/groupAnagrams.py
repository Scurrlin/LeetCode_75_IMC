# Group Anagrams

def groupAnagrams(strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:

# This line defines a function named `groupAnagrams` that takes a list of
# strings (`strs`) as input and returns a list of lists of strings.

    ans = defaultdict(list)

# This line initializes a `defaultdict` named `ans`. A `defaultdict` is a
# dictionary that provides a default value for the key that does not exist. In
# this case, the default value is an empty list (`list`).

    for s in strs:

# This line starts a for loop that iterates over each string `s` in the input
# list `strs`.

        ans[tuple(sorted(s))].append(s)

# This line sorts the string `s`, converts it to a tuple (because lists can't be
# used as dictionary keys in Python, but tuples can), and uses it as a key in
# the `ans` dictionary. It then appends the original string `s` to the list of
# values associated with this key. This effectively groups all anagrams
# together, as anagrams will result in the same key when sorted.

    return list(ans.values())

# This line returns the values of the `ans` dictionary (which are lists of
# anagrams) as a list. This is the final output of the function.
