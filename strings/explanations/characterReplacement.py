# Longest Repeating Character Replacement

def characterReplacement(s: str, k: int) -> int:

# This line defines a function named `characterReplacement` that takes two
# parameters: a string `s` and an integer `k`. The function returns an integer.

    count = {}

# This line initializes an empty dictionary `count` that will be used to keep
# track of the frequency of each character in the string `s`.

    max_count = start = max_length = 0

# This line initializes three variables `max_count`, `start`, and `max_length`
# to 0. `max_count` will keep track of the maximum frequency of any character in
# the current window of the string, `start` is the starting index of the current
# window, and `max_length` is the maximum length of a substring that can be
# obtained by replacing `k` characters.

    for end in range(len(s)):

# This line starts a loop that iterates over the string `s` using the index
# `end`.

        count[s[end]] = count.get(s[end], 0) + 1

# This line increments the count of the character at the `end` index in the
# `count` dictionary.

        max_count = max(max_count, count[s[end]])

# This line updates `max_count` to be the maximum of the current `max_count` and
# the count of the character at the `end` index.

        if end - start + 1 - max_count > k:

# This line checks if the number of characters that need to be replaced in the
# current window is greater than `k`. If it is, then the window is not valid,
# and we need to move the `start` index forward.

            count[s[start]] -= 1

# If the window is not valid, this line decreases the count of the character at
# the `start` index.

            start += 1

# This line moves the `start` index forward by one.

        max_length = max(max_length, end - start + 1)

# This line updates `max_length` to be the maximum of the current `max_length`
# and the length of the current window.

    return max_length

# Finally, this line returns `max_length`, which is the maximum length of a
# substring that can be obtained by replacing `k` characters.
