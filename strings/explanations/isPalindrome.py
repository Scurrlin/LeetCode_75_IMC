# Valid Palindrome

def isPalindrome(s: str) -> bool:

# This line defines a function named `isPalindrome` that takes a string `s` as
# input and returns a boolean value.

    newStr = [char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum()]

# This line creates a new list `newStr`. It iterates over each character `char`
# in the input string `s`. If the character is alphanumeric (i.e., a letter or a
# number), it converts the character to lowercase and adds it to the list. This
# is done using a list comprehension, which is a compact way of creating a new
# list by performing operations on each element of an existing list.

    return newStr == newStr[::-1]

# This line checks if `newStr` is the same as its reverse (`newStr[::-1]`). In
# Python, `newStr[::-1]` creates a reversed copy of the list. If `newStr` is the
# same as its reverse, then the original string `s` is a palindrome (ignoring
# case and non-alphanumeric characters), and the function returns `True`.
# Otherwise, it returns `False`.
