# Maximum Subarray

def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

# This line defines a function named `maxSubArray`. The function takes two
# parameters: `self` and `nums`. `self` is typically used in the context of
# class methods, but here it seems unnecessary as the function isn't part of a
# class. `nums` is expected to be a list of integers. The function is expected
# to return an integer.

    max_sum = nums[0]

# This line initializes a variable `max_sum` to the first element of `nums`.
# This variable will be used to keep track of the maximum subarray sum found so
# far.

    current_sum = nums[0]

# This line initializes a variable `current_sum` to the first element of `nums`.
# This variable will be used to keep track of the current subarray sum.

    for i in range(1, len(nums)):

# This line starts a for loop that iterates from 1 to `len(nums) - 1`. For each
# iteration, the current index is stored in the `i` variable.

        current_sum = max(nums[i], current_sum + nums[i])

# This line updates `current_sum` to the maximum of the `i`-th element of `nums`
# and the sum of `current_sum` and the `i`-th element of `nums`. This
# effectively calculates the maximum subarray sum ending at the `i`-th element.

        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)

# This line updates `max_sum` to the maximum of `max_sum` and `current_sum`.
# This effectively keeps track of the maximum subarray sum found so far.

    return max_sum

# After the loop has finished, this line returns the maximum subarray sum. If
# all numbers in `nums` are negative, `max_sum` will be the maximum number in
# `nums`.
