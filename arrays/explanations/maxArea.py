def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:

# This line defines a function named `maxArea`. The function takes two
# parameters: `self` and `height`. `self` is typically used in the context of
# class methods, but here it seems unnecessary as the function isn't part of a
# class. `height` is expected to be a list of integers. The function is expected
# to return an integer.

    left, right = 0, len(height) - 1

# This line initializes two variables, `left` and `right`, to the first and last
# indices of `height`, respectively. These variables will be used to perform a
# two-pointer search.

    max_area = 0

# This line initializes a variable `max_area` to 0. This variable will keep
# track of the maximum area found so far.

    while left < right:

# This line starts a while loop that continues as long as `left` is less than
# `right`.

        current_area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)

# This line calculates the area of the rectangle formed by the lines at the
# `left` and `right` indices. The area is calculated as the minimum of the two
# heights times the distance between them.

        max_area = max(max_area, current_area)

# This line updates `max_area` to be the maximum of `max_area` and
# `current_area`.

        if height[left] < height[right]:
            left += 1

# If the height at the `left` index is less than the height at the `right`
# index, the function increments `left` by 1. This is because the area is
# limited by the shorter line and moving the right pointer wouldn't help in
# finding a larger area.

        else:
            right -= 1

# Otherwise, the function decrements `right` by 1. This is because the area is
# limited by the shorter line and moving the left pointer wouldn't help in
# finding a larger area.

    return max_area

# After the loop has finished, this line returns the maximum area found. If
# `height` is an empty list, `max_area` will be 0.
