# Maximum Product Subarray

def maxProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

# This line defines a function named `maxProduct`. The function takes two
# parameters: `self` and `nums`. `self` is typically used in the context of
# class methods, but here it seems unnecessary as the function isn't part of a
# class. `nums` is expected to be a list of integers. The function is expected
# to return an integer.

    max_product = nums[0]

# This line initializes a variable `max_product` to the first element of `nums`.
# This variable will be used to keep track of the maximum product found so far.

    current_max = nums[0]

# This line initializes a variable `current_max` to the first element of `nums`.
# This variable will be used to keep track of the maximum product that includes
# the current number.

    current_min = nums[0]

# This line initializes a variable `current_min` to the first element of `nums`.
# This variable will be used to keep track of the minimum product that includes
# the current number.

    for i in range(1, len(nums)):

# This line starts a for loop that iterates from 1 to `len(nums) - 1`. For each
# iteration, the current index is stored in the `i` variable.

        temp_max = current_max * nums[i]

# This line calculates the product of `current_max` and the `i`-th element of
# `nums` and stores it in `temp_max`.

        temp_min = current_min * nums[i]

# This line calculates the product of `current_min` and the `i`-th element of
# `nums` and stores it in `temp_min`.

        current_max = max(nums[i], temp_max, temp_min)

# This line updates `current_max` to the maximum of the `i`-th element of
# `nums`, `temp_max`, and `temp_min`. This is done because the maximum product
# can be the current number itself, the product of the maximum positive product
# so far and the current number, or the product of the maximum negative product
# so far and the current number.

        current_min = min(nums[i], temp_max, temp_min)

# This line updates `current_min` to the minimum of the `i`-th element of
# `nums`, `temp_max`, and `temp_min`. This is done because the minimum product
# can be the current number itself, the product of the maximum positive product
# so far and the current number, or the product of the maximum negative product
# so far and the current number.

        max_product = max(max_product, current_max)

# This line updates `max_product` to the maximum of `max_product` and
# `current_max`. This effectively keeps track of the maximum product found so
# far.

    return max_product

# After the loop has finished, this line returns the maximum product. If all
# numbers in `nums` are negative, `max_product` will be the maximum number in
# `nums`.
