# Contains Duplicate

def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:

# This line defines a function named `containsDuplicate`. The function takes two
# parameters: `self` and `nums`. `self` is typically used in the context of
# class methods, but here it seems unnecessary as the function isn't part of a
# class. `nums` is expected to be a list of integers. The function is expected
# to return a boolean value.

    return len(nums) > len(set(nums))


# This line returns `True` if there are any duplicate values in `nums` and
# `False` otherwise. It does this by comparing the length of `nums` to the
# length of `nums` after it has been converted to a set. A set in Python is an
# unordered collection of unique elements, so any duplicate values in `nums`
# will be removed when it is converted to a set. If the length of `nums` is
# greater than the length of the set, this means that there were duplicate
# values in `nums`.
