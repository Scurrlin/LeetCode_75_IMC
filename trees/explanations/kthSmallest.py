# Kth Smallest Element in a BST

def kthSmallest(root: TreeNode, k: int) -> int:

# This line defines a function `kthSmallest` that takes two arguments: `root`,
# which is an instance of `TreeNode`, and `k`, which is an integer. The function
# is expected to return an integer.

    stack = []

# This line initializes an empty list `stack`. This stack is used to perform an
# iterative in-order traversal of the binary tree.

    while True:

# This line starts an infinite loop. The loop will break when the kth smallest
# element is found.

        while root:

# This line starts a loop that continues as long as `root` is not `None`. This
# loop is used to traverse to the leftmost node of the current subtree.

            stack.append(root)

# This line appends the current `root` to the `stack`.

            root = root.left

# This line updates `root` to its left child.

        root = stack.pop()

# After reaching the leftmost node of the current subtree, this line pops the
# top element from the `stack` and assigns it to `root`.

        k -= 1

# This line decrements `k` by 1. This is because we have visited one more node
# in the in-order traversal.

        if not k:

# This line checks if `k` is 0. If `k` is 0, it means we have found the kth
# smallest element.

            return root.val

# This line returns the value of the kth smallest element if the above condition
# is met.

        root = root.right

# This line updates `root` to its right child. This is because in an in-order
# traversal, after visiting a node, we need to visit its right subtree.

# This function essentially finds the kth smallest element in a binary search
# tree. It does this by performing an in-order traversal of the tree (which
# visits the nodes in ascending order) and stopping at the kth node.
