# Validate Binary Search Tree

def isValidBST(root: TreeNode) -> bool:

# This line defines a function `isValidBST` that takes one argument: `root`,
# which is an instance of `TreeNode`. The function is expected to return a
# boolean value.

    def validate(node, low=float('-inf'), high=float('inf')):

# This line defines an inner function `validate` that takes three arguments:
# `node`, `low`, and `high`. `low` and `high` are optional and default to
# negative and positive infinity, respectively.

        if not node:

# This line checks if `node` is `None`. If `node` is `None`, the function
# returns `True`.

            return True

# This line returns `True` if the above condition is met.

        if node.val <= low or node.val >= high:

# This line checks if the value of `node` is less than or equal to `low` or
# greater than or equal to `high`. If either condition is met, the function
# returns `False`.

            return False

# This line returns `False` if the above condition is met.

        return (validate(node.right, node.val, high) and
                validate(node.left, low, node.val))

# This line recursively calls `validate` for the right and left children of
# `node`. For the right child, `node.val` is passed as `low` and `high` remains
# the same. For the left child, `low` remains the same and `node.val` is passed
# as `high`. The function returns the logical `and` of these two calls.

    return validate(root)

# This line calls the `validate` function with `root` as the argument and
# returns its result.

# This function essentially checks if a binary tree is a valid binary search
# tree (BST). A binary tree is a BST if for every node, all elements in the left
# subtree are less than the node and all elements in the right subtree are
# greater than the node. This process is applied recursively to all nodes in the
# tree.
