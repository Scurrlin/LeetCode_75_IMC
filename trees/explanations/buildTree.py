# Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal

def buildTree(preorder: List[int], inorder: List[int]) -> TreeNode:

# This line defines a function `buildTree` that takes two arguments: `preorder`
# and `inorder`, which are lists of integers. The function is expected to return
# an instance of `TreeNode`.

    if not preorder or not inorder:

# This line checks if either `preorder` or `inorder` is empty. If either is
# empty, the function returns `None`.

        return None

# This line returns `None` if the above condition is met.

    root = TreeNode(preorder[0])

# This line creates a new `TreeNode` with the value of the first element in
# `preorder` and assigns it to `root`.

    mid = inorder.index(preorder[0])

# This line finds the index of the first element of `preorder` in `inorder` and
# assigns it to `mid`.

    root.left = buildTree(preorder[1:mid+1], inorder[:mid])

# This line recursively calls `buildTree` for the left subtree. It uses the
# elements from the second to `mid+1`th element in `preorder` and the elements
# from the start to `mid`th element in `inorder`.

    root.right = buildTree(preorder[mid+1:], inorder[mid+1:])

# This line recursively calls `buildTree` for the right subtree. It uses the
# elements from the `mid+1`th element to the end in `preorder` and the elements
# from the `mid+1`th element to the end in `inorder`.

    return root

# This line returns the `root` node which now represents a binary tree built
# according to the `preorder` and `inorder` traversals.

# This function essentially builds a binary tree from its preorder and inorder
# traversals. The first element in the preorder traversal is the root of the
# tree. The elements before this root element in the inorder traversal form the
# left subtree, and the elements after form the right subtree. This process is
# applied recursively to build the entire tree.
